## <a id='architecture'></a> Architecture Overview

The Splunk Firehose Nozzle for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) has been developed as a Pivotal Elastic Runtime app.
The Nozzle subscribes to the Loggregator endpoint and writes events to an external Splunk environment.

<strong>Inside each nozzle:</strong><%# Should we change these bullets to numbers#%>

* A Golang routine collects events from the Loggregator endpoint.
* An in-memory queue buffers events for availability to multiple Splunk HTTP Event Collector clients.
* The Splunk HTTP Event Collector clients run with their own Golang routines that consume events from the queue to enrich PCF events by attaching metadata fields.
* Finally, the events are batched together and sent to Splunk via the HEC Endpoint.

## <a id='performance'></a> Performance and Sizing Guide

Splunk has tested the Splunk Firehose Nozzle running as a single deployed nozzle on the AWS instance type c4.4xlarge.
This EC2 instance type has 8 CPU and 32 GB memory. Storage is EBS-Only and has dedicated EBS Bandwidth of 2,000 Mbps.

Tests were performed with Structured and Unstructured data with 2 different event sizes 256 and 1024 bytes.
Averaged performance metrics over an extended period of time resulted in the following results

Tests | Events Per Second(EPS) | Mbps | Nozzle Mem Total (MB) | Nozzle Cpu (%)
  --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
  Structured Data(JSON) - 256 byte event size        | `9444`|`7.30`|`530.6`|`57.2`
  Structured Data(JSON) - 1024 byte event size       | `6775`|`10.90`|`567.9`|`79.9`
  Unstructured Data     - 256  byte event size       |`11189`|`9.10`|`502.3`|`58.3`
  Unstructured Data 	- 1024 byte event size       | `9487`|`16.03`|`491.5`|`82.8`

Factoring these optimal testing numbers we recommend the system used to run a single splunk nozzle instance has at least minimum 8 CPUs and 300MB RAM.
